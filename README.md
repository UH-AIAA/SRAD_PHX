# SRAD_PHX

This is the underlying library developed by Nathan, Dedah, and Thanh for the 2025 Phoenix Rocket. I (Nathan Samuell) separated this library from the [scr_flightComputer](www.github.com/UH_AIAA/scr_flightComputer) project to provide a resuable codebase as we transition to a dual-chip computer in the rocket.
